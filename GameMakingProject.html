    <h5> Mileage May Vary is a game that I built in Twine that explores themes of control, conformity, and the slow erosion of identity under systems designed to prioritize productivity over personhood. Set in a surreal desert where drivers are stripped of their names and assigned numbers, the game presents a streamlined journey filled with repetition, hallucinations, and artificial encouragement, which mirrors the relentless grind of modern capitalist work culture. At its core, I intended for the game to be a criticism of the commodification of human life. The player character is a driver, someone who drives a car on an endless road, only stopping to refill and rest. Not an individual, but a component in a machine. My decision to ignore and replace it with a number on their license was intended to represent of how corporate systems depersonalize those they claim to support. The desert setting reinforces this sense of isolation and emotional depletion. Wide open spaces usually evoke a sense of freedom, but here they are empty, repetitive, and directionless. The way I wrote the story ensures that the player has choice, but almost all choices will end up leading to the same conclusion (except for one). This loops back to the primary metaphor: even when modern workers are offered "freedom" from our work culture, these choices often exist within a narrow framework defined by productivity, deadlines, and output expectations. One of the first things I thought of when making this game was the voice from the radio, which could be used to represent many different things. It could be a personification of a capitalist work culture that prioritizes production over the individual, a representation of a cold and uncaring boss who will not hesitate to throw you away when you aren't working correctly, or that inner voice that scolds you for not being productive. I wanted the story to take a much more humorous approach, but as I wrote and the deadline approached, I defaulted to what I know I can write best and took a much darker turn with the story. There are 6 endings in total, 5 of which are pretty bleak and end up with the player character in a losing situation (or dead, in one case). I didn't make this choice consciously, but I think it can reflect how inescapable it feels our work culture is and how deeply its been ingrained in our collective psyches where we can only imagine escaping it in death. The main things determining these endings were 2 variables that would increase or decrease based on the player's choices: mental stability and obedience. I chose these 2 because these 2 things are extremely important to our work culture: how willing we as a society are to partake in capitalism and how mentally capable someone is to be expected to work like a machine for weeks on end without breaking down. Overall, this was a very fun project, although my procrastination does mean that I didn't have nearly enough time to develop ideas and include the elements that I wanted to.</h5>
