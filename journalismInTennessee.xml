  <p>  <title>JOURNALISM IN TENNESSEE</title>


  <p>  The editor of the <fiction type="newspaper">Memphis Avalanche swoops thus mildly down upon a correspondent who posted him as a Radical:—<dialogue>“While he was writing the first word, the middle, dotting his i’s, crossing his t’s, and punching his period, he knew he was concocting a sentence that was saturated with infamy and reeking with falsehood.”</dialogue>—Exchange.

  <p>  I was told by the physician that a Southern climate would improve my health, and so I went down to <territory type="state">Tennessee, and got a berth on the <ficion type="newspaper">Morning Glory and Johnson County War-Whoop as associate editor. When I went on duty I found the <character name="Chief Editor">chief editor</character> sitting tilted back in a three-legged chair with his feet on a pine table. There was another pine table in the room and another afflicted chair, and both were half buried under newspapers and scraps and sheets of manuscript. There was a wooden box of sand, sprinkled with cigar stubs and <dialogue>“old soldiers,”</dialogue> and a stove with a door hanging by its upper hinge. The <character name="Chief Editor">chief editor</character> had a long-tailed black cloth frock-coat on, and white linen pants. His boots were small and neatly blacked. He wore a ruffled shirt, a large seal-ring, a standing collar of obsolete pattern, and a checkered neckerchief with the ends hanging down. Date of costume about 1848. He was smoking a cigar, and trying to think of a word, and in pawing his hair he had rumpled his locks a good deal. He was scowling fearfully, and I judged that he was concocting a particularly knotty editorial. He told me to take the exchanges and skim through them and write up the “Spirit of the Tennessee Press,” condensing into the article all of their contents that seemed of interest.

  <p>  I wrote as follows:

  <p>  SPIRIT OF THE TENNESSEE PRESS

  <p>  The editors of the <fiction type="newspaper">Semi-Weekly Earthquake evidently labor under a misapprehension with regard to the <fiction type="railroad">Ballyhack railroad. It is not the object of the company to leave <fiction type="town">Buzzardville off to one side. On the contrary, they consider it one of the most important points along the line, and consequently can have no desire to slight it. The gentlemen of the Earthquake will, of course, take pleasure in making the correction.

  <p>  <character name="John W. Blossom">John W. Blossom</character>, Esq., the able editor of the <fiction type="newspaper">Higginsville Thunderbolt and Battle Cry of Freedom, arrived in the city yesterday. He is stopping at the <fiction type="place">Van Buren House.

  <p>  We observe that our contemporary of the <fiction type="newspaper">Mud Springs Morning Howl has fallen into the error of supposing that the election of <fiction type="political figure">Van Werter is not an established fact, but he will have discovered his mistake before this reminder reaches him, no doubt. He was doubtless misled by incomplete election returns.

  <p>  It is pleasant to note that the city of <fiction type="town">Blathersville is endeavoring to contract with some New York gentlemen to pave its well-nigh impassable streets with the Nicholson pavement. The <fiction type="newspaper">Daily Hurrah urges the measure with ability, and seems confident of ultimate success.

  <p>  I passed my manuscript over to the <character name="Chief Editor">chief editor</character> for acceptance, alteration, or destruction. He glanced at it and his face clouded. He ran his eye down the pages, and his countenance grew portentous. It was easy to see that something was wrong. Presently he sprang up and said:

  <p>  <dialogue>“Thunder and lightning! Do you suppose I am going to speak of those cattle that way? Do you suppose my subscribers are going to stand such gruel as that? Give me the pen!”</dialogue>

  <p>  I never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so viciously, or plow through another man’s verbs and adjectives so relentlessly. While he was in the midst of his work, somebody shot at him through the open window, and marred the symmetry of my ear.

  <p>  <dialogue>“Ah,”</dialogue> said he, <dialogue>“that is that scoundrel <character name="Smith">Smith</character>, of the <fiction type="newspaper">Moral Volcano—he was due yesterday.”</dialogue> And he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and fired—<character name="Smith">Smith</character> dropped, shot in the thigh. The shot spoiled <character name="Smith">Smith</character>’s aim, who was just taking a second chance and he crippled a stranger. It was me. <humor type="absurdist">Merely a finger shot off.

  <p>  Then the <character name="Chief Editor">chief editor</character> went on with his erasure; and interlineations. Just as he finished them a hand grenade came down the stove-pipe, and the explosion shivered the stove into a thousand fragments. <humor type="absurdist">However, it did no further damage, except that a vagrant piece knocked a couple of my teeth out.

  <p>  <dialogue>“That stove is utterly ruined,”</dialogue> said the <character name="Chief Editor">chief editor</character>.

  <p>  I said I believed it was.

  <p>  <dialogue>“Well, no matter—don’t want it this kind of weather. I know the man that did it. I’ll get him. Now, here is the way this stuff ought to be written.”</dialogue>

  <p>  I took the manuscript. It was scarred with erasures and interlineations till its mother wouldn’t have known it if it had had one. It now read as follows:



  <p>  SPIRIT OF THE TENNESSEE PRESS

  <p>  The inveterate liars of the <fiction type="newspaper">Semi-Weekly Earthquake are evidently endeavoring to palm off upon a noble and chivalrous people another of their vile and brutal falsehoods with regard to that most glorious conception of the nineteenth century, the Ballyhack railroad. The idea that <fiction type="town">Buzzardville was to be left off at one side originated in their own fulsome brains—or rather in the settlings which they regard as brains. They had better swallow this lie if they want to save their abandoned reptile carcasses the cowhiding they so richly deserve.

  <p>  That ass, <character name="John W. Blossom">Blossom</character>, of the <fiction type="newspaper">Higginsville Thunderbolt and <fiction type="newspaper">Battle Cry of Freedom, is down here again sponging at the Van Buren.

  <p>  We observe that the besotted blackguard of the <fiction type="newspaper">Mud Springs Morning Howl is giving out, with his usual propensity for lying, that Van Werter is not elected. The heaven-born mission of journalism is to disseminate truth; to eradicate error; to educate, refine, and elevate the tone of public morals and manners, and make all men more gentle, more virtuous, more charitable, and in all ways better, and holier, and happier; and yet this blackhearted scoundrel degrades his great office persistently to the dissemination of falsehood, calumny, vituperation, and vulgarity.

  <p>  <fiction type="town">Blathersville wants a Nicholson pavement—it wants a jail and a poorhouse more. The idea of a pavement in a one-horse town composed of two gin-mills, a blacksmith shop, and that mustard-plaster of a newspaper, the <fiction type="newspaper">Daily Hurrah! The crawling insect, <character name="Buckner">Buckner</character>, who edits the <fictiont type"newspaper">Hurrah, is braying about his business with his customary imbecility, and imagining that he is talking sense.

  <p>  <dialogue>“Now that is the way to write—peppery and to the point. Mush-and-milk journalism gives me the <noun def="extreme nervousness/unease">fan-tods.”</dialogue>

  <p>  <humor type="absurdist">About this time a brick came through the window with a splintering crash, and gave me a considerable of a jolt in the back. I moved out of range—I began to feel in the way.

  <p>  The <character name="Chief Editor">chief</character> said, <dialogue>“That was the <character name="Colonel Blatherskite Tecumseh">Colonel</character>, likely. I’ve been expecting him for two days. He will be up now right away.”</dialogue>

  <p>  He was correct. The <character name="Colonel Blatherskite Tecumseh">Colonel</character> appeared in the door a moment afterward with a dragoon revolver in his hand.

  <p>  He said, <dialogue>“Sir, have I the honor of addressing the poltroon who edits this mangy sheet?”</dialogue>

  <p>  <dialogue>“You have. Be seated, sir. Be careful of the chair, one of its legs is gone. I believe I have the honor of addressing the putrid liar, <character name="Colonel Blatherskite Tecumseh">Colonel Blatherskite Tecumseh</character>?”</dialogue>

  <p>  <dialogue>“Right, Sir. I have a little account to settle with you. If you are at leisure we will begin.”</dialogue>

  <p>  <dialogue>“I have an article on the ‘Encouraging Progress of Moral and Intellectual Development in America’ to finish, but there is no hurry. Begin.”</dialogue>

  <p>  Both pistols rang out their fierce clamor at the same instant. The <character name="Chief Editor">chief</character> lost a lock of his hair, and the <character name="Colonel Blatherskite Tecumseh">Colonel's</character> bullet ended its career in the fleshy part of my thigh. The <character name="Colonel Blatherskite Tecumseh">Colonel's</character> left shoulder was clipped a little. They fired again. Both missed their men this time, but I got my share, a shot in the arm. At the third fire both gentlemen were wounded slightly, and I had a knuckle chipped. <humor type="absurdist">I then said, I believed I would go out and take a walk, as this was a private matter, and I had a delicacy about participating in it further. But both gentlemen begged me to keep my seat, and assured me that I was not in the way.

  <p>  They then talked about the elections and the crops while they reloaded, and I fell to tying up my wounds. But presently they opened fire again with animation, and every shot took effect—but it is proper to remark that five out of the six fell to my share. The sixth one mortally wounded the <character name="Colonel Blatherskite Tecumseh">Colonel</character>, who remarked, with fine humor, <humor type="absurdist">that he would have to say good morning now, as he had business uptown. He then inquired the way to the undertaker’s and left.

  <p>  The <character name="Chief Editor">chief</character> turned to me and said, <dialogue>“I am expecting company to dinner, and shall have to get ready. It will be a favor to me if you will read proof and attend to the customers.”</dialogue>

  <p>  I winced a little at the idea of attending to the customers, but I was too bewildered by the fusillade that was still ringing in my ears to think of anything to say.

  <p>  He continued, <dialogue>“<character name="Jones">Jones</character> will be here at three—cowhide him. <character name="Gillespie">Gillespie</character> will call earlier, <humor type="absurdist">perhaps—throw him out of the window. <character name="Ferguson">Ferguson</character> will be along about four—<humor type="absurdist">kill him. That is all for today, I believe. If you have any odd time, you may write a blistering article on the police—give the chief inspector rats. The cowhides are under the table; weapons in the drawer—ammunition there in the corner—lint and bandages up there in the pigeonholes. In case of accident, go to <character name="Lancet">Lancet</character>, the surgeon, downstairs. He advertises—we take it out in trade.”</dialogue>

  <p>  He was gone. I shuddered. At the end of the next three hours I had been through perils so awful that all peace of mind and all cheerfulness were gone from me. <character name="Gillespie">Gillespie</character> had called and thrown me out of the window. <character name="Jones">Jones</character> arrived promptly, and when I got ready to do the cowhiding he took the job off my hands. In an encounter with a stranger, not in the bill of fare, I had lost my scalp. Another stranger, by the name of Thompson, left me a mere wreck and ruin of chaotic rags. And at last, at bay in the corner, and beset by an infuriated mob of editors, blacklegs, politicians, and desperadoes, who raved and swore and flourished their weapons about my head till the air shimmered with glancing flashes of steel, I was in the act of resigning my berth on the paper when the <character name="Chief Editor">chief</character> arrived, and with him a rabble of charmed and enthusiastic friends. Then ensued a scene of riot and carnage such as no human pen, or steel one either, could describe. People were shot, probed, dismembered, blown up, thrown out of the window. There was a brief tornado of murky blasphemy, with a confused and frantic war-dance glimmering through it, and then all was over. In five minutes there was silence, and the gory <character name="Chief Editor'>"chief"</character> and I sat alone and surveyed the sanguinary ruin that strewed the floor around us.

  <p>  He said, <humor type="absurdist"><dialogue>“You’ll like this place when you get used to it.”</dialogue>

  <p>  I said, <dialogue>“I’ll have to get you to excuse me; I think maybe I might write to suit you after a while; as soon as I had had some practice and learned the language I am confident I could. But, to speak the plain truth, that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences, and a man is liable to interruption.”</dialogue>

  <p>  <dialogue>“You see that yourself. Vigorous writing is calculated to elevate the public, no doubt, but then I do not like to attract so much attention as it calls forth. I can’t write with comfort when I am interrupted so much as I have been to-day. I like this berth well enough, but I don’t like to be left here to wait on the customers. The experiences are novel, I grant you, and entertaining, too, after a fashion, but they are not judiciously distributed. A gentleman shoots at you through the window and cripples me; a bombshell comes down the stove-pipe for your gratification and sends the stove door down my throat; a friend drops in to swap compliments with you, and freckles me with bullet-holes till my skin won’t hold my principles; you go to dinner, and <character name="Jones">Jones</character> comes with his cowhide, <character name="Gillespie">Gillespie</character> throws me out of the window, Thompson tears all my clothes off, and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the easy freedom of an old acquaintance; and in less than five minutes all the blackguards in the country arrive in their war-paint, and proceed to scare the rest of me to death with their tomahawks. Take it altogether, I never had such a spirited time in all my life as I have had to-day. No; I like you, and I like your calm unruffled way of explaining things to the customers, but you see I am not used to it. <humor type="irony">The Southern heart is too impulsive; Southern hospitality is too lavish with the stranger. The paragraphs which I have written to-day, and into whose cold sentences your masterly hand has infused the fervent spirit of Tennesseean journalism, will wake up another nest of hornets. All that mob of editors will come—and they will come hungry, too, and want somebody for breakfast. I shall have to bid you adieu. I decline to be present at these festivities. I came South for my health, I will go back on the same errand, and suddenly. Tennesseean journalism is too stirring for me.”</dialogue>

  <p>  <humor type="irony">After which we parted with mutual regret, and I took apartments at the hospital.
