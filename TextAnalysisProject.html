    <h5>The process of encoding texts from Project Gutenberg in XML and the exploration of aforementioned texts in Voyant Tools revealed many  insights into the structure, themes, and rhetorical strategies of each work. These tools, while serving different functions (encoding for clarity on the texts and Voyant for surface-level analysis of the content's structure) complement each other, helping the reader gain a deeper understanding of the texts than they would have by simply reading.</h5>
    <h5>Encoding each text in XML required attention to hierarchy of tags and the narrative function of what I was tagging. The act of tagging elements like
      &lt;dialogue&gt;, &lt;character&gt;, and &lt;def&gt; forced me to line-by-line with each one of the texts, trying to spot out nuances often overlooked by the average reader. For instance, here's an excerpt of the encoding I used for one of my texts:</h5>
    <div>
    <h5>&lt;dialogue&gt;"The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise,"&lt;/dialogue&gt; announced &lt;character name="Framton Nuttle"&gt;Framton&lt;/character&gt;, who laboured under the tolerably widespread delusion that total strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least detail of oneâ€™s ailments and infirmities, their cause and cure.  &lt;dialogue&gt;"On the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement,"&lt;/dialogue&gt; he continued.</h5>
    </div>
    <h5>The way I tagged not only identified where dialogue was happening, but also gave the name of the character speaking, helped me track who is saying what more closely. The repeated need to encode &lt;dialogue&gt; and &lt;character&gt; shows how dialogue-heavy the texts I chose are. The nature of the dialogue in these texts also vary, with some texts being dialogues between multiple characters in multiple situations and others being one-on-one conversations</h5>
    <h5>While encoding helped me understand the structure of the texts, Voyant allowed me to see the bigger picture of the texts and allowed me to see patterns throughout the texts. Using Cirrus and Trends tools, I examined the frequency of different words throughout the texts. For example:</h5>
    <div>
    
    </div>
    <h5>As you can see, the most common word across all of my texts is "said" (1570 instances), appearing nearly three times as often as the word in second place, "man" (538 instances). This serves as further proof as to how dialogue heavy short stories I chose to analyze are, . </h5>
